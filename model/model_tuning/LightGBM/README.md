Four models are used for parameter tuning: **FLAML**, **Optuna**, **Random Search**, **Grid Search**

About the **optuna** parameter tuning method for LightGBM, because the seed is random, the results generated by each run of optuna will be different, but if the seed is fixed, it may not be able to get the global optimal solution, and _the uploaded parameter tuning result is the current optimal solution_.
